Neovim is participating in Google Summer of Code 2025!

If you're a student and want to work on Neovim for GSoC, start here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code

The next steps are:
1. If you have a project idea or want to take one of the items listed there,
   create a new issue (which you can update over the next days/weeks) with
   a scope/proposal. Aim for "clarity without verbosity".
2. Start getting familiar with the codebase by working on one or more
   [complexity:low](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acomplexity%3Alow) issues (or any other issue that feels tractable).

Thank you for your interest in Neovim!
